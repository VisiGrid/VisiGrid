Plugin Exception

Plugins that use only the documented public plugin API are not considered
derivative works and may be licensed independently. This means you can create
proprietary plugins for VisiGrid without being required to open-source them,
as long as they interact with VisiGrid solely through the public API.

What's allowed:
- Proprietary plugins using the public plugin API
- Commercial plugins sold independently
- Internal plugins for your organization

What requires AGPLv3:
- Modifications to VisiGrid's core source code
- Plugins that link against private/internal modules
- Forks or derivatives of the core engine

---

Commercial Licensing

If the AGPLv3 doesn't work for your use case, commercial licenses are available.
Contact licensing@visigrid.app for:

- Embedding VisiGrid in proprietary software
- Hosting VisiGrid as a service without releasing source code
- Distributing modified versions in closed-source products
