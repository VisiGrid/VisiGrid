# Changelog

## 0.3.0

Preview the past. Rewind the workbook. Verify it in CI.

### Provenance History (Pro)

VisiGrid records *why* the grid changed — not just *that* it changed.

- **History tab** shows a git-log-style list of high-level actions (Paste, Fill, Sort, Clear, Multi-edit).
- **Select an entry** to view a canonical, read-only Lua snippet describing the action in deterministic A1 notation.
- **Copy the Lua snippet** to share, document, or audit how a sheet was produced.
- **Filter history** by label or scope.

**Pro feature:** View + Copy Lua provenance. Free users see the history list and can upgrade to export provenance.

**Shortcut:** `Ctrl+Shift+Y` opens History.

### Soft Rewind Preview (Pro)

Hold Space on a history entry to preview the workbook state *before* that action — without mutating anything.

- **Space + ↑/↓ scrubbing**: Navigate through history previews while holding Space.
- **Preview banner**: Clear "PREVIEW" status with action summary and position [N/M].
- **Preview safety gates**: Aborts with explicit errors on unsupported actions or integrity issues — no silent skips, no wrong previews.
- **Sort-aware preview**: Preview replays include sort state with lightweight `PreviewViewState` (no full app snapshot).

### Hard Rewind (Pro)

Commit to a preview and revert the workbook to that historical state.

- **"Rewind to here..."** button in history detail panel.
- **Two-phase commit**: Builds plan, validates fingerprint, then atomically applies.
- **Audit trail**: Appends a non-undoable `Rewind` record with 128-bit blake3 fingerprint.
- **Confirmation dialog**: Shows discard count and target context badge.

### CLI Replay (CI-Ready)

New command for headless provenance verification. Designed for CI pipelines: verify provenance scripts deterministically.

```bash
visigrid-cli replay script.lua --verify      # Verify fingerprint
visigrid-cli replay script.lua -o output.csv # Export to CSV/TSV/JSON
visigrid-cli replay script.lua --fingerprint # Print fingerprint only
visigrid-cli replay script.lua --verify -q   # CI mode (quiet)
```

- Full Lua bindings for all `grid.*` operations.
- Nondeterministic function detection (NOW, RAND, TODAY, RANDBETWEEN) — fails `--verify` with clear error.
- Golden test scripts in `tests/golden/`.

### Named Range Intelligence (Pro)

Named ranges are now first-class model entry points.

- **Named range details** show value preview, depth, verified status, and usage count.
- **Quick Open** (`Ctrl+P`) includes named ranges by default.
- **One-click tracing** highlights dependencies for the selected named range.

### Dialog Standardization

Reusable dialog primitives in `gpui-app/src/ui/`:

- `modal.rs` — backdrop + centering
- `dialog_frame.rs` — DialogFrame, DialogSize
- `button.rs` — consistent button styles

Migrated 10 dialogs to shared components.

### Also

- macOS: Added Help → License menu item
- Replay semantics match live app (validation replace-in-range, named range full payloads)
- History fingerprinting now cryptographic and order-sensitive (blake3)
- Theme refresh (contrast + readability improvements)
- Formula bar enhancements
