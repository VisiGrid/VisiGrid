# Changelog

## 0.2.8

*This release completes VisiGrid's explainability loop: verified values, visible dependencies, and provable changes.*

### Explainability: Provenance History (Pro)

VisiGrid now records *why* the grid changed — not just *that* it changed.

- **New History tab** shows a git-log-style list of your latest actions (Paste, Fill, Sort, Clear, Multi-edit).
- **Selecting an entry** reveals a read-only Lua snippet that describes the action in deterministic A1 notation.
- **Copy the Lua snippet** to share, document, or audit how the sheet was produced.
- **Filter box** to quickly find relevant actions by label or scope.

**Pro feature:** Lua provenance + Copy. Free users see the list and can upgrade to view/export provenance.

**Shortcut:** `Ctrl+Shift+Y` opens History.
